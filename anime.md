I think anime & video games stand at the perfect intersection of computers, art & mathematics. I don't play much video games these days, but I do catch some anime from time to time. It reminds me why I chose to learn about computers - _to make something beautiful_ (yeah, Steve Jobs said that too, I know, I think he was onto something).

Anyways, here goes my heavily opinionated and arguably superior suggestions for anime.

### 1. Azumanga Daioh

Peak comedy.

### 2. Nichijou

Pure work of art. Second highest peak in the comedy mountain range.

### 3. Children Who Chase Lost Voices

One of the finest works of Makato Shinkai. The music is great too.

### 4. Your Name

I bet you've already heard about this one. Another masterpiece by Makato Shinkai. You'll love the title track.

### 5. Weathering With You

Lots of rain in this one. Rain makes for great visuals.

### 6. Suzume

Great music. Good story. Memorable characters.

### 10. 5 Centimeters Per Second

I remember watching it but have totally forgotten what the story was about.

## 11. A Silent Voice

I have no memory of this one honestly. It was kinda meh though.

## Studio Ghibli

Ghibli is its own genre. You should watch all Ghibli movies. They'll probably restore your hope in humanity. Also, the music - I still listen to them while working. It's _that_ good.

P.S. I hate _Attack on Titans_. Just putting it out there.
