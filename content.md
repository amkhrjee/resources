Hi! This is my index of all the resources that I think are good and worth keeping a note of. You can also checkout my [book recommendations](/books.html). I also maintain a very opinionated list of [anime recommendations](/anime.html), if you're into that sort of stuff.

## Programming Languages

### JavaScript & TypeScript

I highly recommend learning JS fromÂ [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/). It's like the missing documentation to the language. TheÂ [official documentaion](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)Â is good enough for getting started with TypeScript.

### Python

TheÂ [official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)Â is good enough.Â *Head First Python*Â is good too. Just write a lot of code.

### C & C++

Although learning C is not a prerequisite to learning C++, I recommened you learn C first anyway. The folllowing are excellent books for getting started with C.

- *The C Programming Language*Â by K&R
- *Effective C: An Introduction to Professional C Programming*Â by Robert Seacord
- *Expert C Programming: Deep Secrets*Â by Peter van der Linden

For C++,Â [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/)Â provides excellent tutorials.

### Rust

I learnt Rust (and still learn, when needed) fromÂ [Brown University's fork](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/)Â of the officialÂ Rust book. I also encourage you to checkout [this youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwhLlO5Vugx6KCwTpW_4fUeES2jdkDSW9&si=6ZjA9GpD9rijoDOOi) by the channel *300 seconds of Rust*.

[This](https://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/error-handling.html) is a excellent article on error handling in Rust.

### Go

Inspired by melkeydev's video, I learnt Go fromÂ [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1). I haven't had the opportunity to use Go in any of "real" projects, so this section will have updates when I actually use Go in production.

### Java

*Head First Java*Â is a good introduction to the language. Perhaps you'll also need to go throughÂ *Head First Design Patterns*, which uses Java.

### x86 Assembly

I had picked upÂ *Assembly Language for x86 Processors*Â by Kip R. Irvine from my university library in 2022 and I think it taught me quite a bit of assembly in a weekend.

## Computer Architecture

I think these two books work as excellent introduction to the subject:

- *Computer Organization & Architecture*Â by William Stallings
- *Computer Architecture: A Quantitive Approach*Â by Hennessy & Patterson

[Prof. Onur Mutlu's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@OnurMutluLectures)Â is a treaure trove of extremely good CompArch lectures, including the cutting-edge stuff.

## Memory Managenent

Read the paperÂ [What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf)Â by U. Drepper.

I've found thisÂ [Youtube Lecture Series by Prof. Black-Schaffer](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiwt1iVUib9s2Uo5BeYmwkDFUh70fJPxX&si=1296I6Su6qnl2lLe)Â to be extremely helpful for learning how virtual memory works.

[These videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjgw_ONy8oIDjV3r0bOawg6dECNQuEqiA&si=tEpHPuTAIsuw5nJw)Â by David Tarnoff are great for learning about cache memory and data alignment.

## Operating Systems

My personal favourite is the bookÂ Operating System ConceptsÂ by Silberschatz, Gagne & Galvin.

I've heard good things about theÂ [Operating System: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)Â book too.

I also finished theÂ [Fundamentals of Operating Systems](https://os.husseinnasser.com/)Â course by Huussein Nasser and would definitely recommend it.

## Compilers

AlthoughÂ [the dragon book](https://www-2.dc.uba.ar/staff/becher/dragon.pdf)Â is the standard when it comes to compiler design, I'd recommend against jumping on it first.

Instead, pick upÂ [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)Â by Robert Nystrom to get a first-hand experience of how interpreters are built in the real world. You can look intoÂ [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)Â orÂ [Writing a Compiler in Go](https://compilerbook.com/)Â too. Both are written by Throsten Ball.

## Databases

I got my introduction to databases from the standard textÂ Fundamentals of Database SystemsÂ by Elmasri & Navathe. It provides a good mathematical grounding for further, more practical explorations into the field.

Brian Holt has nice courses onÂ [databases](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-databases/)Â &Â [SQL](https://sql.holt.courses/).

Hussein Nasser's courseÂ [Fundamentals of Database Engineering](https://www.udemy.com/share/102qyG3@Fvnc6x7tlacTisw21juVcPzvxNmll_azBs6uHO9PRaM-Ym3U8lSmAp43x1ZEPNHdvA==/)Â is more than excellent for getting your feet wet into the nitty-gritties of the field.

## Discrete Mathematics

*Discrete Mathematics & Its Application*Â by Kenneth Rosen probably has everything you'll ever need. I actually readÂ *Essentials of Discrete Mathematics*Â by David Hunter and found it more accessible than the Rosen book.

## Calculus

A working knowledge of Calculus is essential for machine learning and some branches of theoretical computer science. I'd highly recommend going throughÂ Calculus: Concepts & ContextsÂ by Stewart & Kokoska. It covers vector calculus along with all the necessary prerequisites.

Grant Sanderson'sÂ [_Essence of Calculus_](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-GT3co4r2wlh6UHTUeQsrf3mlS2lk6x&si=zrOjWLl0kob4m0oD)Â playlist is a must-watch.

## Linear Algebra

Some say ML & AI is just glorified Linear Algebra. Just like thousands others, I also got started withÂ *Introduction to Linear Algebra*Â by Gilbert Strang. You can also read theÂ [Manga Guide to Linear Algebra](https://nostarch.com/linearalgebra)Â if you're a weeb.

Grant Sanderson'sÂ [Linear Algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=qjnue7M0er4lEWx9)Â playlist is a must-watch. You can also watchÂ [Gilbert Strang's MIT lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)Â (and can download them using my toolÂ [ocwd](https://github.com/amkhrjee/ocwd)Â ðŸ˜…).

## Probability & Statistics

[Introduction to Probability for Data Science](https://probability4datascience.com/)Â by Stanley Chan is the single best book I've ever read on the subject.  
I readÂ *Head First Statistics*Â and I think it provides a good overview of the subject.

I also readÂ Statistics for People Who Think They Hate Statistics in RÂ while taking aÂ [Data Science course](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc21_cs23/preview)Â from IIT Madras.

## Developer Tools & Utilities

ThePrimeagen'sÂ [Everything You'll Need to Know About Git](https://theprimeagen.github.io/fem-git)Â is a pretty good Git tutorial. If you're looking for more advanced stuff, you should probably head toÂ [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).

Brian Holt'sÂ [Complete Intro to Containers v2](https://containers-v2.holt.courses/)Â is a great place to start learning about containers & Docker.

## AWS Certifications

I got my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification (yeah, that's a mouthful) by bingeing [Neal Davis's Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams-c) in 6 days. He's really good at explaining stuff.

I also made my notes [public](https://satisfying-wallet-4a1.notion.site/AWS-Certs-Prep-f608a6f62fe04059bbf739f2b238bbb0).

## Natural Language Processing

Currently reading [NLP in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/natural-language-processing-in-action) and I think it works as a good intro to the subject.
