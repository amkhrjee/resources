I am mostly reading scifi these days, along with some non-fiction.

Here are the books I enjoyed the most recently.

### Project Hail Mary

Read this if you like more science in your fiction. Extremely enjoyable.

### 1984

A classic. Only recently got the time to read it. Thought provoking. The author was born in Bihar btw.

### Design as Art

Has some nice illustrations. Talks about why design should be both functional and beautiful.

### Revolutionaries

Talks about the rebel movements & revolutionaries of pre-independent India. I'm a history nerd so I really liked this one.
