The books are listed in no particular order, or rather, in the order I remembered them while writing this. I read all sort of books and this hopefully this list reflects just that. If you're on Goodreads, you can checkout my [profile](https://www.goodreads.com/amkhrjee).

- **Project Hail Mary** by Andy Weir. One of my favorite science fictions of all time. They're even making a movie out of it! Throughouly enjoyable and has lots of cool science. A total page turner.

- **Metamorphosis** by Franz Kafka. A masterpiece. Amazing how relatable it was despite of being a rather strange work of fiction.

- **White Nights** by Freydor Dostoevsky. A rather poetic novella about solitude. Good read.

- **1984** by George Orwell. A classic. Only recently got the time to read it. Thought provoking. The author was born in Bihar btw.

- **Design as Art** by Bruno Murari. Has some nice illustrations. Talks about why design should be both functional and beautiful. Oddball book I picked up because I thought I was good at sketching. I am not.

- **Infinite Powers** by Steven Strogatz. Talks about the history of Calculus. Lots of fun maths history trivia. Has an image of Newton's notebook where he discovers integrals for the first time!

- **Revolutionaries** by Sanjeev Sanyal. Talks about the rebel movements & revolutionaries of pre-independent India. I'm a history nerd so I really liked this one.

- **The Incredible History of India's Geography** by Sanjeeev Sanyal. Enjoyed this one thorughly. Good gift material for kids too.

- **Let's Talk Money** by Monika Halan. Personal finance stuff. Very well written. Covers a lot of ground.

- **Cosmos** by Carl Sagan. Magnum opus of Carl Sagan. Inspiring & revealing. A must read.
