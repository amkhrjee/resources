Although I'm mostly reading academic books for the last few years, I try to squeeze out some time for other sort of books too.

## Recommended

### Project Hail Mary

Read this if you like more science in your fiction. Extremely enjoyable.

### 1984

A classic. Only recently got the time to read it. Thought provoking. The author was born in Bihar btw.

### Design as Art

Has some nice illustrations. Talks about why design should be both functional and beautiful. Oddball book I picked up because I thought I was good at sketching. I am not.

### Revolutionaries

Written by Sanjeev Sanyal. Talks about the rebel movements & revolutionaries of pre-independent India. I'm a history nerd so I really liked this one.

### The Incredible History of India's Geography

Another one by Sanjeev Sanyal. Enjoyed this one thorughly. Good gift material for kids too.

### Let's Talk Money

By Monika Halan. Personal finance stuff. Very well written.

### Cosmos

Magnum opus of Carl Sagan. Inspiring & revealing. A must read.
